APIne Framework
================

APIne is a simple to use modular MVC Framework ready for the IotT (Internet of the Things). It intends to be a general purpose framework and API providing session management, authentication, routing, and DAL abstraction without including useless tools.

The most notable features include a conplete session manager (login, logout, registration and password restoration) with basic users and permissions and a database abstraction layer that prevents you to write every queries.

## Requirements
* PHP 5.4.0 or greater

The project must be set in a virtual host that allows rewrites for routes to work.
